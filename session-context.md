# Session Context: Callback System Complete

## Session Summary

Successfully completed the callback system implementation for ClearFlow, replacing the Observer pattern with a more standard callback approach. The system is production-ready with full test coverage and integrated into examples.

## Completed Work

### 1. Callback System Core ✅
- Implemented `CallbackHandler` base class with 4 lifecycle methods
- Created `CompositeHandler` for multiple callback support with error isolation
- Integrated callbacks into `MessageFlow` with zero overhead when disabled
- 17 comprehensive tests achieving 100% coverage
- All quality checks passing

### 2. Observer Pattern Removal ✅
- Deleted `clearflow/observer.py` and `tests/test_observer.py`
- Updated `clearflow/__init__.py` exports
- Maintained backward compatibility

### 3. ConsoleHandler Implementation ✅
- Created `examples/shared/console_handler.py`
- Fully immutable and stateless design
- Removed timing state to comply with immutability requirements
- Always shows full message content (removed verbose option)
- Provides colored output for Commands (→ cyan) and Events (← magenta)

### 4. Portfolio Example Update ✅
- Updated `portfolio_flow.py` to always use ConsoleHandler
- Simplified `main.py` to rely on ConsoleHandler for output
- Removed redundant printing logic
- All quality checks passing

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Immutable ConsoleHandler**: Removed timing functionality to achieve full immutability
2. **Always verbose**: Examples always show full message content for better understanding
3. **Static methods**: Made helper methods static where appropriate
4. **Public API**: All static methods called with class name must be public

## Current State

- **Core**: Callback system fully integrated into MessageFlow
- **Tests**: 95 tests passing with 100% coverage
- **Examples**: Portfolio example using callbacks, others pending
- **Quality**: All checks passing (architecture, immutability, complexity, etc.)

## Next Steps

See plan.md for remaining tasks:
- Add LoadingIndicator to chat and RAG examples
- Update documentation to mention callback system
- Ensure all examples demonstrate best practices
