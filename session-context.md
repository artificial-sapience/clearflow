# Session Context: Observer to Callbacks Migration

## Session Summary

This session focused on completing message_flow API documentation and making a critical architectural decision to replace the Observer pattern with an industry-standard Callback system.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Message Flow API Documentation ✅
- Updated `clearflow/message_flow.py` with comprehensive docstrings
- Documented the type erasure rationale for handling union types
- Explained the explicit routing pattern design decision
- Removed code examples from docstrings per user preference

### 2. Chat Example Improvements ✅
- Fixed complexity issue in UserNode (Grade B to A) by extracting helper functions
- Renamed `AssistantMessageSent` to `AssistantMessageReceived` for conceptual symmetry
- Established proxy pattern: UserNode ↔ Human (console), AssistantNode ↔ LLM (API)

### 3. Observer Pattern Analysis

Discovered fundamental design issues with current Observer implementation:
- **Misleading name**: "Observer" implies passive watching but can halt flows
- **Principle of least surprise violation**: Security enforcement through observers is hidden control flow
- **Wrong abstraction**: Conflates observation with control

## Critical Architectural Decision

### Replace Observer with Callbacks

**Rationale**:
1. **Industry standard**: LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy all use callbacks
2. **MLflow requirement**: Callbacks are required for integration (not monkey-patching)
3. **Clear semantics**: Callbacks are for integration hooks, not control flow
4. **Separation of concerns**: Security/validation belong in explicit nodes

**Key Insight**: The user pointed out that Observer's fail-fast behavior for security is surprising - security should be an explicit node in the flow, not hidden in an observer.

## Implementation Approach

### Callback Design
- Pure observation, no flow control
- Errors logged but don't propagate
- Four lifecycle points: flow_start, node_start, node_end, flow_end
- Zero overhead when no callbacks attached

### Migration Strategy
1. Implement callbacks alongside observers
2. Update all tests and examples
3. Remove observer pattern completely
4. Create clearflow-mlflow integration package (separate)

## Documentation Created

### 1. Callback Specification (`docs/callback-specification.md`)
- 18 numbered requirements
- Industry context and analysis
- Test mapping for each requirement
- Comparison with Observer pattern

### 2. Implementation Plan (`plan.md`)
- 5 phases with specific tasks
- Each task maps to requirements
- Definition of done: quality-check.sh passes 100%
- Tests use only public API

## Technical Details

### Changed Files
- `clearflow/message_flow.py` - Enhanced documentation
- `examples/chat_message_driven/` - Renamed message types, simplified nodes
- `docs/callback-specification.md` - Created formal specification
- `plan.md` - Implementation roadmap

### Key Code Changes

1. **Message naming symmetry**:
   - Before: `UserMessageReceived`, `AssistantMessageSent`
   - After: `UserMessageReceived`, `AssistantMessageReceived`

2. **Flow builder order**:
   ```python
   flow = message_flow("name", start_node)
       .with_callbacks(handler)  # Before routing
       .route(...)
       .end(...)  # Terminal operation
   ```

## Next Priority

Begin Phase 1 of callback implementation (see plan.md):
- Task 1.1: Implement CallbackHandler base class
- Task 1.2: Add callback support to MessageFlow builder
- Task 1.3: Implement callback invocation

## Important Context

- Observer pattern is still in place and working
- All tests pass with 100% coverage
- No breaking changes made yet
- Callback specification is complete and approved
- User emphasized: callbacks observe, they don't control
