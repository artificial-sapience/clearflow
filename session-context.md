# Session Context: Pydantic Generic ABC Limitation Discovery

## Session Overview

This session focused on resolving the Pydantic BaseModel migration blocker. We discovered a fundamental Pydantic limitation with generic ABC inheritance that prevents completion of the migration.

## Key Discovery: Pydantic Cannot Handle Generic ABCs

### The Problem
Pydantic's runtime validator fails when instantiating classes that:
1. Inherit from a generic ABC (Abstract Base Class)
2. Are instantiated with unresolved TypeVars (inside generic methods)
3. Have the ABC as a Pydantic BaseModel

### Why This Happens
When `_MessageFlowBuilder.end()` tries to create `_MessageFlow[TStartMessage, TEndMessage]`:
- Python's type system is fine with the TypeVars
- But Pydantic's runtime validator sees `Node[TypeVar, TypeVar]`
- It thinks we're trying to instantiate an abstract class directly
- Fails with: `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Node[TypeVar, TypeVar]`

### Why This Is Unusual
Most developers don't hit this because:
- They instantiate with concrete types: `MyClass[str, int](...)`
- They don't use generic ABCs with Pydantic BaseModel
- They don't create instances inside generic functions where TypeVars are unresolved

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. Global `revalidate_instances` Change
- Changed from `'always'` to `'never'` in `StrictBaseModel`
- **Rationale**: No safety benefit for frozen models, 1.7x performance gain
- **Discovery**: `'always'` provides zero additional safety for immutable models

### 2. MessageFlow Architecture Changes
- Made `MessageFlow` private (`_MessageFlow`)
- Removed from public exports
- Changed `end()` to return `Node[TStartMessage, TEndMessage]`
- **Rationale**: Follow same pattern as `_Flow` in `clearflow/__init__.py`

### 3. Field Naming Fix
- Removed underscore prefixes from `_MessageFlow` fields
- Changed `_start_node` → `start_node`, etc.
- **Rationale**: Pythonic best practice - class is already private

### 4. Builder Pattern Update
- Converted `_MessageFlowBuilder` from Pydantic to frozen dataclass
- **Rationale**: Internal helper doesn't need Pydantic validation

### 5. Test Infrastructure Fixes
- Fixed test nodes redefining parent fields
- Changed `FrozenInstanceError` to `ValidationError` expectations
- Fixed `CompositeHandler` instantiation

## Current State

### What Works ✅
- All architecture compliance checks pass
- All immutability checks pass
- All linting and formatting pass
- All type checking (Pyright) passes
- Core library quality at 100%

### What's Blocked ❌
- One test fails: `test_callback_error_handling`
- Root cause: Pydantic generic ABC limitation
- Blocks test suite completion

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `clearflow/strict_base_model.py` - Changed revalidate_instances
- `clearflow/message_flow.py` - Multiple changes (see above)
- `clearflow/__init__.py` - Removed MessageFlow export

### Test Files
- `tests/test_callbacks.py` - Fixed ProcessorNode field redefinition
- `tests/test_message.py` - Fixed ValidationError expectations
- `tests/test_message_flow.py` - Removed private field access test

## Next Steps

See `plan.md` for decision options. Recommended approach is **Option A: Duck Typing** to avoid Pydantic's limitation entirely.
