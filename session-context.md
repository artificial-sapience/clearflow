# Session Context: Callback System Implementation

## Session Summary

Completed the core callback system implementation for ClearFlow, successfully replacing the Observer pattern with a more standard callback approach. The system is fully functional with 100% test coverage.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Callback System Core (Phases 1-3) ✅
- Implemented `CallbackHandler` base class with 4 lifecycle methods
- Added `CompositeHandler` for multiple callback support with error isolation
- Integrated callbacks into `MessageFlow` with zero overhead when disabled
- Created 17 comprehensive tests achieving 100% coverage
- All quality checks pass (linting, formatting, type checking, complexity)

### 2. Observer Pattern Removal (Phase 4.1) ✅
- Deleted `clearflow/observer.py` and `tests/test_observer.py`
- Updated `clearflow/__init__.py` exports
- Maintained 100% test coverage after removal
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 3. Examples Update (Phase 4.2) ⏳
- Created `examples/shared/console_handler.py` with colored output
- Created `LoadingIndicator` context manager for async operations
- **Current blocker**: Immutability linter flagging internal mutable state

## Technical Decisions

### Key Design Choices
1. **Non-abstract base class**: CallbackHandler uses default no-op implementations
2. **Error isolation**: Callback errors are logged to stderr but don't propagate
3. **Synchronous execution**: Callbacks execute in order, not concurrently
4. **Zero overhead**: No performance impact when callbacks=None

### Quality Standards Maintained
- 100% test coverage through public API only
- Zero suppressions (all linting issues fixed at root cause)
- Pyright strict mode compliance
- Grade A complexity for all functions

## Current State

### What's Working
- Complete callback system in `clearflow/callbacks.py`
- Full integration with MessageFlow
- All tests passing with 100% coverage
- Observer pattern completely removed

### What's In Progress
- ConsoleHandler implementation blocked by immutability linter
- Portfolio example needs logging migration to callbacks
- Loading indicators need to be added to all examples

### Known Issues
1. **ConsoleHandler linting**: The immutability linter flags the internal `_start_times: dict[str, datetime]` even though it's private mutable state needed for tracking timing.

## Next Steps

See plan.md for detailed task breakdown. Priority items:
1. Resolve ConsoleHandler linting issue (fix or get suppression approval)
2. Migrate portfolio example logging to use callbacks
3. Add loading indicators to all examples
4. Complete Phase 5 documentation

## Important Context

- The callback system is **production-ready** - only example/documentation work remains
- All core functionality is complete and tested
- The immutability linter is very strict, even flagging internal mutable state in examples
- Examples must pass the same quality standards as core code (per CLAUDE.md)
