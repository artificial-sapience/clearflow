# Session Context: Message Routing Type Validation

## Session Overview

We implemented runtime type validation for ClearFlow's message routing system, ensuring type safety when routing messages between nodes. This involved significant architectural improvements to how routes are stored and validated.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. RouteKey Structure Change

**Before**: `tuple[type[Message], str]  # (outcome, node_name)`
**After**: `tuple[NodeInterface[Message, Message], type[Message]]  # (from_node, outcome)`

**Rationale**:

- More intuitive ordering matching conceptual flow
- Uses actual node instances (hashable due to frozen dataclasses)
- Eliminates string-based lookups

### 2. Route Storage Change

**Before**: `Mapping[RouteKey, NodeInterface | None]`
**After**: `tuple[RouteEntry, ...]` where `RouteEntry = tuple[RouteKey, NodeInterface | None]`

**Rationale**:

- Flows typically have <10 routes
- Linear search is acceptable for small collections
- Makes `_Flow` fully immutable and naturally hashable
- Solves hashability issues when flows contain flows

### 3. Type Validation Implementation

Created helper functions to extract and validate types:

- `_get_node_output_types()`: Extracts valid output types from node
- `_get_node_input_types()`: Extracts valid input types for node
- `_validate_route_types()`: Validates compatibility between nodes

### 4. Python 3.13+ Optimizations

- Using `types.UnionType` instead of `typing.Union`
- Simplified union detection with `isinstance()`
- Removed legacy union handling code

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### TypeVar Handling

**Problem**: Generic flows use TypeVars that `get_type_hints()` returns as TypeVar objects, not concrete types.
**Solution**: Skip validation for TypeVars since they represent generic parameters bound at runtime.

### Flow Hashability

**Problem**: Flows weren't hashable when containing dicts, preventing use in RouteKey.
**Solution**: Changed to tuple-based route storage, making flows naturally hashable.

### Union Type Compatibility

**Problem**: Need to handle `X | Y` union syntax and validate against them.
**Solution**: Use `types.UnionType` detection and `get_args()` to extract constituent types.

## Current State

### Working Features

- Type validation during flow construction
- Proper handling of union types
- Support for flows as nodes (composability)
- All existing tests pass

### Coverage Status

- Overall: ~95% coverage
- Uncovered lines: Error paths in validation functions (lines 91-94, 106-108, 111-114)
- Need tests for invalid routing scenarios

### File Changes

**Modified files:**

- `clearflow/_internal/flow_impl.py`: Main implementation
- `clearflow/__init__.py`: Removed obsolete message_type property

**Key changes in flow_impl.py:**

- Added validation helper functions
- Changed RouteKey and route storage
- Updated _get_next_node to use linear search
- Added type validation to _validate_and_create_route

## Git Status

- Branch: `message-driven`
- Modified files tracked in git
- Ready for testing completion

## Next Session Should

1. Add test cases for uncovered validation code
2. Run quality checks to ensure 100% coverage
3. Verify all linting passes
4. Consider committing changes if all checks pass
