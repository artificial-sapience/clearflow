# Session Context: Type Safety Vulnerability in Terminal Type Pattern

## Session Summary

Completed documentation for terminal type pattern, then discovered a **CRITICAL type safety issue** where PEP 695's variance inference undermines the pattern's guarantees.

## Completed Work

### Documentation Updates
-  Added Terminal Type Pattern section to README.md
-  Added Migration Guide (v2.0) to README.md
-  Updated CLAUDE.md with correct API patterns and examples
-  Fixed all "zero dependencies" claims ’ "minimal dependencies"
-  Regenerated llms.txt files with updated information
-  All quality checks pass at 100% coverage

### CLAUDE.md Corrections
- Fixed Core Concepts: Nodes use `process()` not `exec()`
- Removed non-existent lifecycle hooks (`prep()`, `post()`)
- Updated to Pydantic models, not frozen dataclasses
- Corrected code size: ~1000 lines (not ~250)
- Fixed public API exports in examples
- Removed duplicate sections (DRY principle)

## Critical Discovery: PEP 695 Variance Issue

### The Problem

User noticed that `create_chat_flow()` has incorrect return type:
```python
def create_chat_flow() -> Node[StartChat, UserMessageReceived | ChatCompleted]:
    # But end_flow(ChatCompleted) returns Node[StartChat, ChatCompleted]!
```

Type checkers (pyright 1.1.405, mypy 1.18.1) don't catch this error!

### Root Cause Analysis

PEP 695's automatic variance inference based on usage:
```python
class Node[TMessageIn: Message, TMessageOut: Message]:
    async def process(self, message: TMessageIn) -> TMessageOut: ...
```

Because:
- `TMessageIn` only appears in **input position** ’ inferred as **contravariant**
- `TMessageOut` only appears in **output position** ’ inferred as **covariant**

This makes `Node[StartChat, ChatCompleted]` assignable to `Node[StartChat, UserMessageReceived | ChatCompleted]`!

### Test Cases Created

1. `/tmp/test_type_issue.py` - Demonstrates the problem with chat flow
2. `/tmp/test_covariance.py` - Tests covariance behavior
3. `/tmp/variance_bug_demo.py` - Simple demonstration
4. `/tmp/two_params.py` - Shows issue specific to two-parameter generics
5. `/tmp/variance_inference.py` - Confirms variance is being inferred

### Key Finding

**This is NOT a bug** in type checkers - it's correct PEP 695 behavior! The issue is we need **invariant** type parameters for type safety, but PEP 695 infers them as covariant/contravariant based on usage.

Traditional TypeVars DO catch this:
```python
TOut = TypeVar('TOut', bound=Message)  # Invariant by default
# This WOULD be caught as an error
```

## Implications

1. **Type safety compromised**: Functions can claim incorrect union return types
2. **Terminal type pattern undermined**: Can't enforce single terminal type at type-check time
3. **All examples potentially affected**: Need to audit all flow return types

## Tools and Versions

- **pyright**: 1.1.405 (latest)
- **mypy**: 1.18.1 (installed during session)
- **Python**: 3.13.3 (using PEP 695 syntax)
- **pydantic**: 2.11.0+ (only dependency)

## Next Steps

See `plan.md` for prioritized tasks. Critical decision: How to fix variance issue?
- Switch to traditional TypeVars?
- Force invariance through usage patterns?
- Document limitation and fix annotations?
