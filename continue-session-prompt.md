# Continue Session: Implement API Symmetry Enhancement

Please help me implement the API symmetry enhancement for ClearFlow's `complete_flow` method.

## Context

See `session-context.md` for:
- Previous accomplishments (message routing validation with 100% coverage)
- Current focus (API symmetry and union terminal types)
- Technical architecture details
- Quality standards to maintain

## Task

See `plan.md` for the detailed 8-task implementation plan.

## Starting Point

We need to implement Task 1 from the plan: Update the FlowBuilder abstract interface.

Specifically:
1. Update `complete_flow` signature in `clearflow/flow.py`
2. Rename `from_node` â†’ `ending_node` for symmetry
3. Keep backward compatibility
4. Run `./quality-check.sh clearflow/flow.py` to ensure it passes 100%

## Important Requirements

- Maintain 100% test coverage at all times
- Each task must pass `./quality-check.sh` before moving to the next
- No linter suppressions without explicit approval
- All code must achieve Grade A complexity
- Use frozen dataclasses and tuples (not lists) for immutability

## Success Criteria

After completing all tasks in `plan.md`:
- Union terminal types are fully supported
- API is symmetric between `create_flow` and `complete_flow`
- All existing tests still pass (backward compatible)
- New tests demonstrate union terminal functionality
- Full quality check passes with 100% coverage

Let's start with Task 1 from the plan.
