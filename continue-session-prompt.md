# Continue Session: Complete Message Routing Type Validation

Please help me complete the message routing type validation implementation for ClearFlow.

## Context

See `session-context.md` for full session history and architectural decisions made.
See `plan.md` for the current task list and progress.

## Current Status

We've successfully implemented runtime type validation for message routing with significant architectural improvements:

- Changed RouteKey to use node instances instead of names
- Replaced dict-based routing with immutable tuple storage
- Added type validation functions that handle Python 3.13+ union syntax

## Immediate Task

**Add test coverage for validation code** - We need to reach 100% coverage by testing the error paths in the validation functions.

The uncovered lines are in `clearflow/_internal/flow_impl.py`:

- Lines 91-94: Invalid output type error
- Lines 106-108: Generic type handling
- Lines 111-114: Invalid input type error

## Steps to Complete

1. Add test cases for invalid routing scenarios
2. Run `./quality-check.sh` to verify 100% coverage
3. Fix any remaining linting issues
4. Verify all tests pass

## Success Criteria

- 100% test coverage
- All quality checks pass
- Ready to commit the changes

Let's start by adding the missing test cases to achieve full coverage.
