# Continue Session Prompt

Use this prompt to continue our work:

---

Please continue our ClearFlow message_flow API work.

**Context**: See session-context.md for implementation details. We successfully completed Phase 1, implementing explicit source node routing that matches the original flow API pattern.

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Core API redesigned with `.route(from_node, outcome, to_node)` syntax
- ✅ Type erasure solution implemented for union type flexibility
- ✅ All tests passing with 100% coverage
- ✅ All examples updated and working

**Next Priority** (from plan.md):
Phase 2, Task 2.1: Update API documentation in message_flow.py to:
- Reflect new routing signatures
- Explain the type erasure approach and why it's needed
- Add docstring examples showing common patterns (loops, convergence, error handling)
- Document the design decision to match original flow API

Please review session-context.md and plan.md, then begin the documentation updates.
