# Continue Pydantic BaseModel Migration Session

Please read the following context files to understand the current state:

1. @session-context.md - Full context from this session including completed work
2. @plan.md - Remaining tasks and current progress

## Current Task

We're at the final step of Phase 3A: Achieving Maximum Type Safety.

## Immediate Next Step

**Phase 3A.7: Full clearflow/ directory validation**

Please:
1. Run `./quality-check.sh clearflow/` to validate the entire directory
2. Verify that NO `arbitrary_types_allowed` exists anywhere in the codebase
3. Run the test suite to ensure all functionality still works
4. If any issues arise, fix them while maintaining immutability compliance

## Key Technical Context

- We've successfully removed all `arbitrary_types_allowed` from the codebase
- All callback handlers now inherit from StrictBaseModel
- We use `Mapping` for type annotations (not `dict`) to satisfy immutability linter
- MessageFlow and _MessageFlowBuilder no longer have custom model_config

## Success Criteria

- Quality check must pass 100% on entire clearflow/ directory
- No `arbitrary_types_allowed` anywhere
- All types are validated Pydantic types
- Tests must pass

After completing Phase 3A.7, proceed to Phase 4: Remove strict_dataclass Module (see plan.md)
