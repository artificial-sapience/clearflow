# Continue Pydantic BaseModel Migration Session

Please read the following context files to understand the current state:

1. @session-context.md - Full context from previous session including completed work
2. @plan.md - Remaining tasks and current progress

## Current Task

We're migrating ClearFlow's message-driven architecture from Pydantic dataclasses to Pydantic BaseModel for maximum type safety, correctness, and proper generic support.

## Immediate Next Step

**Phase 2: Node Infrastructure to BaseModel**

Start by converting the `Node` class in `clearflow/message_node.py`:
1. Change from `@strict_dataclass` to inherit from `StrictBaseModel`
2. Ensure generic type parameters work with PEP 695 syntax
3. Update validators as needed
4. Run `./quality-check.sh clearflow/message_node.py`

## Key Context

- We created `StrictBaseModel` as our base class with strictest validation
- Message, Event, and Command classes already migrated successfully
- No backwards compatibility needed (feature branch)
- NodeProtocol workaround can be removed once MessageFlow uses BaseModel

## Success Criteria

- All quality checks must pass 100%
- Maintain Grade A complexity
- Preserve all validation rules
- Generic types must work properly

Continue with Phase 2 as outlined in the plan!
