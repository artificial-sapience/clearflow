# Continue Session Prompt

Use this prompt to continue our work:

---

Please continue the ClearFlow callback system implementation.

**Context**: See session-context.md for the architectural decision to replace Observer with Callbacks. We completed the callback specification (docs/callback-specification.md) and created an implementation plan (plan.md).

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Callback specification complete with 18 requirements
- ✅ Implementation plan created with 5 phases
- ✅ Message flow API documentation updated
- ⏳ Observer pattern still in place (to be replaced)

**Next Task**: Begin Phase 1, Task 1.1 from plan.md:
- Implement CallbackHandler base class (REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003, REQ-004)
- Create clearflow/callbacks.py
- Update clearflow/__init__.py
- Ensure quality-check.sh passes 100%

**Important**:
- Tests must use only public API
- No suppressions without explicit approval
- Each task must pass quality-check.sh before proceeding
- Callbacks observe but don't control flow (errors logged, not propagated)

Please review session-context.md and plan.md, then begin Task 1.1.
