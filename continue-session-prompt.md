Please continue the ClearFlow callback system implementation.

**Context**: See session-context.md for the current state. We've completed Phase 1 (Core Implementation) and started Phase 3 (Testing). The callback system is functional but needs comprehensive testing.

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 complete: CallbackHandler, MessageFlow integration, error handling
- ‚è≥ Task 3.2 in progress: tests/test_callbacks.py has linting issues to fix
- üìã Coverage at ~50%: Need to complete all tests for 100% coverage

**Immediate Task**: Fix the linting issues in tests/test_callbacks.py Task 3.2:
- Remove unused variable `flow`
- Fix exception string literal issues in ErrorHandler
- Complete test_callback_error_logging and test_callback_execution_order
- Ensure `./quality-check.sh tests/test_callbacks.py` passes 100%

**Important Reminders**:
- Tests must use ONLY public API (from clearflow import ...)
- No suppressions without explicit approval
- Must achieve 100% coverage through public API
- Callbacks observe but don't control (errors logged, not propagated)

**Next Steps After Task 3.2**:
1. Complete Tasks 3.3 and 3.4 for full test coverage
2. Consider if Phase 2 (CompositeHandler) is needed before Phase 4
3. Phase 4: Remove Observer pattern completely
4. Update examples with new callback system

Please review session-context.md and plan.md, then continue with fixing Task 3.2 tests.
