# Continue Session Prompt

Please read @session-context.md and @plan.md to understand where we left off.

We discovered that Pydantic cannot handle generic ABC inheritance when TypeVars are unresolved at runtime. This blocks our Pydantic BaseModel migration.

The immediate task is to implement **Option A: Duck Typing** from the plan:
1. Make `_MessageFlow` NOT inherit from `Node`
2. Implement the same interface (name field, async process method)
3. Use `cast()` in `end()` to satisfy the type checker

This should fix the failing test `test_callback_error_handling` and unblock the migration.

After fixing this blocker, continue with the remaining tasks in plan.md.
