# Update Project Memory

Please review our collaboration session and update @CLAUDE.md with any important learnings, patterns, or knowledge that should be preserved across sessions.

## Instructions

1. **Review what we accomplished** in this session
2. **Identify key learnings** that would help in future sessions
3. **Update CLAUDE.md** with:
   - Technical discoveries or gotchas
   - Workflow patterns that worked well
   - Common issues and their solutions
   - Documentation principles we established
   - Any project-specific knowledge gained

## Guidelines for updates

- **Be concise** - Only add what's truly valuable for future sessions
- **Be specific** - Include concrete examples, commands, or code patterns
- **Avoid repetition** - Don't duplicate existing content
- **Stay factual** - No opinions or philosophy, just technical facts
- **Keep it proportional** - CLAUDE.md should stay under 300 lines
- **Review and delete outdated information** - Meticulously analyze @CLAUDE.md for anything no longer correct or relevant

## Areas to consider
