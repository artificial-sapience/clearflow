# Type Safety Analyzer - Remaining Tasks

## Current Status âœ… PRODUCTION READY
The type safety analyzer is **fully functional and production-ready**:
- âœ… **Full DSPy Type Safety**: Pydantic models throughout, no JSON parsing
- âœ… **Unified Architecture**: DSPy models ARE the message format
- âœ… **Rich Observer Output**: Detailed analysis with LLM reasoning and all fixes
- âœ… **Cache Control**: `--cache` flag for development vs production use
- âœ… **Minimal Main**: CLI focused, observer handles all UX
- âœ… **100% Quality Compliance**: All linters pass without suppressions
- âœ… **Real Testing**: 8 issues found in hard_cases.py with 87.5% fix coverage
