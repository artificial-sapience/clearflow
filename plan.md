# ClearFlow Development Plan

## Recently Completed (This Session)
✅ Added alpha version warning and pinning recommendation to README.md
✅ Added comprehensive field descriptions to all Pydantic models for LLM understanding
✅ Fixed portfolio analysis example with proper Literal types for type safety
✅ Researched existing Python linters for magic string detection

## In Progress Tasks

### Task 1: Implement Magic String Detection
**Status**: Research complete, implementation pending

Findings:
- Pylint has `magic-value-comparison` rule (R2004)
- Ruff supports PLR2004 (same rule, faster)
- Can be generalized beyond just our specific Literal types

Options:
1. **Enable existing rules** in ruff/pylint configuration
2. **Create custom linter** for ClearFlow-specific patterns
3. **Hybrid approach**: Use ruff PLR2004 + custom linter for domain rules

### Task 2: Version and Release Strategy
**Status**: Planning needed

Since we're in alpha (0.x.y):
- Document breaking changes are expected
- Consider semantic versioning within alpha
- Update pyproject.toml classifiers if needed

## Future Tasks

### Documentation Enhancement
- Update llms.txt with new field descriptions
- Add migration guide for Literal type usage
- Document linter configuration for type safety

### Type Safety Improvements
- Review all examples for string literal usage
- Consider adding more Literal types for other enums
- Add type safety tests to prevent regressions

## Success Criteria
✅ All Pydantic models have LLM-friendly descriptions
✅ Portfolio analysis uses type-safe Literal types
- [ ] Magic string detection automated via linter
- [ ] All examples pass type safety checks
- [ ] Documentation updated for type safety patterns
