# Message Flow API Redesign Plan

## Executive Summary

Redesign the message_flow API to use explicit source nodes in routing (like the original flow API) instead of the current `from_node()` grouping approach. This change will improve UX by enabling sequential thinking about workflows rather than node-centric thinking.

**Core Design Principle**: The message_flow API should provide the EXACT same UX as the original flow API, just with message types instead of state objects and message types instead of string outcomes. All constraints remain identical (single termination, orphan checking, reachability validation).

## Problem Statement

Current API forces awkward patterns:

- **Node-centric thinking**: Must group all routes from a node together
- **Single end() restriction**: Can only call `.end()` once, forcing reordering
- **Loop handling**: Awkward to express "some outputs continue, one terminates"
- **Breaks flow narrative**: Can't define routes in logical sequence

## Solution: Explicit Source Node API

Return to explicit source nodes in each route call, maintaining the EXACT same UX as the original flow API but with message types:

```python
# Original flow API (for reference)
flow("Name", start_node)
.route(source_node, "outcome_string", dest_node)
.end(final_node, "outcome_string")  # Single termination enforced

# New message_flow API (same UX, different types)
message_flow("Name", start_node)
.route(source_node, MessageType, dest_node)
.route(source_node, MessageType, dest_node)
.end(source_node, MessageType)  # Single termination enforced
```

**Key principle**: The message_flow API should feel IDENTICAL to the flow API, just replacing:

- State objects → Message types
- String outcomes → Event/Message types
- Everything else remains the same (single termination, orphan checking, reachability validation)

## What Stays the Same (from flow API)

These constraints and features from the original flow API MUST be preserved:

1. **Single termination enforcement** - Exactly one `.end()` call allowed
2. **Orphan node detection** - All nodes must be reachable from start
3. **Reachability validation** - Can only route from reachable nodes
4. **Route uniqueness** - Each (node, outcome) pair can only have one route
5. **Explicit routing** - All outcomes must be explicitly handled
6. **Builder pattern** - Fluent interface for flow construction
7. **Type safety** - Full type inference and checking

The ONLY changes are:

- Use message types instead of state objects
- Use message types instead of string outcomes for routing
- Nodes process messages instead of state

## Critical Quality Requirement

**EVERY task must end with running `./quality-check.sh` on affected files**

- No task is complete until quality checks pass 100%
- No suppressions allowed without explicit user approval
- Fix root causes, never suppress violations
- Cannot proceed to next task with any quality failures

4. **Quality compliance**: Zero violations across entire codebase
5. **Examples work**: All three examples functional with real APIs
6. **Quality gates**: Every task passes `./quality-check.sh` 100%
7. **UX parity**: Feels identical to flow API, just with message types

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Breaking existing code
  - **Mitigation**: Clear migration guide, consider deprecation period

- **Risk**: Type inference complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, may need cast() in complex cases

- **Risk**: Performance impact
  - **Mitigation**: Profile before/after, optimize if needed

- **Risk**: Quality regressions
  - **Mitigation**: Run quality checks after EVERY change, fix immediately

## Current Status

**chat_message_driven example**: Partially refactored to simplified 2-node design (UserNode, AssistantNode) but blocked by current message_flow API limitations. Will be completed after Phase 1.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Start with Phase 1, Task 1.1 - modify core message_flow.py
2. **Run `./quality-check.sh clearflow/message_flow.py` - fix ALL violations**
3. Only proceed to next task after 100% quality compliance on updated files
4. Continue pattern: implement → quality check → fix → verify → next task
